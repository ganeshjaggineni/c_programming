Balaji Kamal, a famous astrologer is developing software to automate his work. He wants to find weekday, number of days in the given month and year type (Leap year or not). Write a program to implement the following based on the userâ€™s choice.



Read weekday number (1-7) and print weekday name (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) according to given weekday number using switch case statement. 
Read month value and print the total number of days in input month using switch.
Check whether the given year is a leap year or not
Input format

Second line of input is Month Number



Third line of input is the year

Output format
Weekday name

Number of days in the given month

Leap year or not



Refer sample outputs for exact statement and format

Code constraints
